/**
We use these options in the tsconfig.json file to allow our mocha tests to be written
in Javascript but still allow for typscript files to be tested. 

Whether this is a good idea, remains to be seen. It is more of a hack, but it
seems to work for our purposes. Ideally we should be using TSC for our 
unit tests as well. - Muhammed Anwar
